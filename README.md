## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I encountered I guess was creating a web project. I had been working with swift and x code for the past 3 months. Brushing up on my web development skills had me notice the specific differences between native mobile programming and web development languages. The only challenge I had was making sound work, as in when I was debugging I wasnâ€™t sure if my browser was having issues or if it was the code. In the end, I restarted my machine and it was an IT issue and not software issue.




3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? 
The only question I can think of,  when is web development languages viable to use over native mobile development languages? Is it for budget reasons or does it matter up to a certain user scale. Is there a point in a legacy product when it is more viable to use docker & kubernetes vs building up a native mobile application.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. 

For this project, if I had more hours available, I would add a registration page hooked up to a MongoDB database. The reasoning behind this is to save history between users and see how the user can get better at the game. I would also like to have added a timer and score tracker which would be calculated by speed and accuracy. After this is implemented, I would add better functionality by devices so they are optimized for a variety of screen sizes. A reward feature could also be added to the game based on how many levels are completed or by adding a payment system. With a video sharing API I would also like to add group matches with friends where they can have video chat support.
